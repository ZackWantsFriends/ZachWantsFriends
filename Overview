So based on conversations, the core concept is a stealth action platformer starring a zombie who wants friends,
but since he's the last zombie, he has to make new friends.

The basic/umbrella mechanics that would support this would be
movement
hiding
attacking

So the levels would be about turning all the enemies to zombies.

1: MOVEMENT

2: HIDING
  have various objects to hide in that all have similar basic mechanics but mostly only visually different.
  A closet, a locker, a box, statue, trash cans
  Similar to Sneak King.

3: ATTACKING
  The player pretty much can't attack them head on, and has to rely on attacking from behind or from within hiding.
  
  The animation for attacking humans would be something along the lines of just hugging them.
  It's the POV of the zombie, and to him he's just hugging people and making new friends,
  but to the humans he's just straight murderizing them and creating more zombies.

4: ENEMIES
  The humans would all have weapons and pretty good reaction time if they see you.
  They Shoot on sight, so players have to take them from behind for sure
  
So hiding behind something while they walk past and then jump them would be the optimal strategy
